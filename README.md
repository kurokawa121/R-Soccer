# Visualization Project with R and Shiny

![Universe.gif](Universe.gif)

## Overview

Welcome to my visualization project repository! In this project, I utilized R to create  visualizations based on specific attributes extracted from a data-set. These visualizations aim to provide clear and comprehensive insights into the underlying data.

## Features

-   **Data Import and Subset**: I imported a large data-set into R and created several subsets to work with smaller, more manageable data-sets for analysis.

-   **Height vs Weight Visualizations**: I created visualizations comparing the height and weight of all players in the data-set, providing insights into the distribution and potential relationships between these attributes.

-   **Club-Based Analysis**: I generated visualizations specifically focusing on players from 10 selected clubs. This included scatter plots comparing height and weight within these clubs and box-and-whisker plots to compare weight distributions among the selected clubs.

-   **Interactive Player Search**: I developed a Shiny web application that allows users to search for any player from any club within the data-set. Users can input specific criteria such as player name, club, age, height, and weight to narrow down their search.

-   **Filtering Options**: The Shiny app provides filtering options for age, height, and weight, enabling users to refine their search based on these attributes and explore the data-set interactively.

## Usage

To explore the visualizations and interact with the Shiny app:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the project in RStudio or any preferred R environment.
3.  Run the scripts provided to generate visualizations and launch the Shiny app.
4.  Explore the visualizations and interact with the Shiny app to gain insights from the data.
